Theme: Every 10 seconds

Ideas:

* Puzzle and/or platformer where game runs in 10 second chunks. in between
  chunks, player inputs set of instructions that will run on the next chunk

primary:
- Deck Builder!! Cards provide possible instructions
- - To start: 1 card = 1 sec
- - - Basic cards:
      - move 1 sqr
      - attack once
      - cast simple spell
- - Card Rarity: More rare cards have better effects
- Grid Based so movement can be accurately planned
- Each Instruction given by card, will list time cost and ability
- Top Down rogue lite dungeon crawler

Secondary:
- enemy behavior occurs during separate 10 seconds from player actions.
- Equipment cards that add modifiers

Tertiary:
- rpg elements? (level, skills?)
